# Dear my best friend and partner who I have yet to meet.

I'm young. I just started out in the world, and I'm massively flawed. I can't expect to rely on finding a girlfriend or best friend to motivate me to becoming who I want to be. To be who you want to be, that has to be done on your own. 

And so, I am not ready to meet you yet. And I believe now that for our relationship to be the ones of our dreams, we both must be at a certain point in our lives. Having one person just figuring it out while having another already achieving what they want to be will not work out.

When we meet, I expect both of us to share the following accomplished dreams, traits, and having shared interests would be great.

Accomplished Dreams (Required)-
>Created Software/Hardware company to turn their ideas into reality.
>Giving the best in everything that they do, from waking up every morning to learning, working, and more.
>Healthy body and healthy posture.
>Ability to confidently speak, lead, listen in public, groups, and connect with other human beings.

Traits (Required) -
-Calm, confident. Non judging and empathetic. Still, we try to bring the best out of ourselves, our friends, our family, and others with a calm manner. 
-Clear communicator of desires, wants, dislikes, etc.
-Nonjudgemental of physical traits that cannot be changed. And judgemental on things that can be changed.
-Doesn't use hard drugs and realizes that various recreational activities (video games, partying, etc.) are fun but should only be done only so often.
-Having good life habits that no longer need conscious thought but come automatically (being organized, waking up early, eating healthy, etc.)
-Respect for the lives and opinions of others.
-Does not smoke.

Career Interests (Very Important, I want to be able to work and learn with you.)-
-Software, hardware, mechanics, business, philanthropy.

General Interests (Not required, but important)-
-Cooking
-Travelling
-Fitness Events (Marathons, Triathalons,
-Physical Sports/Activities (Soccer, badminton, hopefully!)
-Having a family in the future.
-Pets/Animals
-Atheist

When I am ready and at the point in life where I have become who I wanted to be and doing what I want to be doing, then I'll indicate below that I am. If you are too, then message this account that you have also done the following. I will not be checking this file every day. I will check at the beginning of every month to see you are ready to meet me. And you should do the same as well (unless you meet the one in person). 

If I manage to find you in real life, then I'll close this file as I won't be needing it anymore. I will not date anyone until I know I am ready as a person.

Now, some may wonder, you're only expecting perfect. What happened to for better or for worse? I am not a judgemental person. For me, and I for you my future dear, take challenges with a smile. There is no shame in messing up as long as you have given it your best.
